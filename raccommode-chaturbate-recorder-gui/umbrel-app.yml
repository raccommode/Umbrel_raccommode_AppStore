  DockerChaturbateRecorderGUI provides a simple web interface to automatically
  record live streams from Chaturbate. Manage a watchlist, set folder/stream limits,
  and let the app spawn dedicated recorder containers for each active stream using
  Docker. Recordings are stored on your Umbrel in the app's data directory.

  Note: This app launches additional Docker containers for each recording using
  the Docker socket. Ensure you have enough disk space and bandwidth.
